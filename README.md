### About

This package is a lightweight tool kit intended to facilitate common
dataset transformations for projects operating under the Upper Colorado River
Endangered Fish Recovery Program.   

It provides rich ancillary data intended to easily add value to datasets.  
The package includes tables to join for "pretty names", vectors to facilitate
subsetting the various classes of species (native, nonnative, endangered), and
several classification functions. The functions are useful in assigning reach designations to data based on river and river mile and age classes to a subset
of species (all endangered species, walleye, smallmouth bass and northern pike).

**Note**: This project is currently under active development.  Code will change
and breaking changes will be made!  If you are considering use in an automated
report, I recommend forking this repo.
