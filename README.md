### About

This is mainly a data package intended to provide rich ancillary data intended
to easily add value to datasets.  The package includes vectors to facilitate
subsetting, and several classification functions. These functions are useful
in assigning reach designations to data based on river and river mile and age
classes to a subset of species (all endgangered species, walleye, smallmouth
bass and northern pike).

**Note**: This project is currently under active development.  Code will change
and breaking changes will be made!  If you are considering use in an automated
report, I recommend forking this repo.
